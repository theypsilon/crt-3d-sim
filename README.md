# CRT 3D Sim
Port of [Retro-Display-Simulator](https://github.com/theypsilon/Retro-Display-Simulator) to the web, using rust, wasm, and webgl2.

Demo at [theypsilon.github.io/crt-3d-sim](https://theypsilon.github.io/crt-3d-sim).

Testing Rust with WebAssembly for first time was a great learning experience.
